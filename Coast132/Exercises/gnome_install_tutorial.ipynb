    "Hi there. We're going to make the NOAA GNOME plotting tools work for us. I haven't used these before, so I'm going to document the steps that I go through to get this going. Figuring out how to get little snippets of code to work can be both infuriating and gratifying. When something doesn't work--or you don't know what to do next--it's maddening. But when you finally stumble on the right Stack Exchange post or someone's blog/tutorial and suddenly can make it work, it's almost like magic that you suddenly have a whole new set of tools at your disposal. With that, I hope you find some of this useful! "

    "* code: the commands (or _syntax_) that we use to make calculations or plots within Pything\n",
    "* script: a file containing code. The .ipynb file can be considered to be a sort of interactive script\n",
    "* function: a portion of code that does a specific task, like calciulating distance between two given points. Functions can be defined within a script or module\n",
