    "**Due Feb. 8, 2021, 12:30 pm**\n",
    ">### Instructions \n",
    ">\n",
    ">  **When you submit this assignment, replace \"GEOG132\" with your LAST NAME**, then download from Jupyter as an *HTML file*, and upload to GauchoSpace.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> For this assignment you will analyze spatial and temporal patterns in water quality in Campus Lagoon. The goals for this assignment are to:\n",
    "> - learn to make plots showing spatial data in Python\n",
    "> - interpret the observations in the context of possible physical drivers\n",
    "> - think about coastal ecosystems using a control volume approach\n",
    "> - link space and time through flow rates\n",
    "> \n",
    "> #### The Situation \n",
    "> \n",
    "> You work for an environmental consulting company that has been hired to conduct a study of water quality conditions in UCSB's Campus Lagoon. Your company has been asked to, specifically, assess eutrophiciation and hypoxia concerns. You are in the early stages of Phase I of the project, which involves initial site characterization and baseline (dry weather) monitoring. Your boss asks you to produce a report that:\n",
    "> - describes why and how nutrients and oxygen demand are linked in coastal waters\n",
    "> - gives an overview of the lagoon\n",
    "> - presents the results of your initial sampling effort\n",
    "> - proposes a comprehensive monitoring plan for both dry and wet conditions\n",
    ">\n",
    ">### You are busy, and were able to hire someone to go collect data for you... These data include:\n",
    "> ####  Water quality conditions in Campus Lagoon\n",
    ">  The following were collected with a YSI 2030 Pro\n",
    "> - temperature\n",
    "> - conductivity\n",
    "> - dissolved oxygen\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The above data were collected in a longitudinal transect (along the length of the lagoon) and sampled at both the surface and near the bed (when possible). \n",
    "> \n",
    "> Additionally, a PME MiniDOT was deployed for two weeks prior to the longitudinal samling. The resulting timeseries of temperature and dissolved oxygen in the lagoon is availabe to provide context to the point samples collected using the YSI."

    "# Background \n",
    "> **Write a two-part introduction**. The **first part** should describe how nutrient enrichment leads to eutrophiciation and hypoxia in coastal ecosystems. Your goal is to provide context for the reader to understand the data presented later in the report. This synthesis should come from the reading assignment (one chapter in each of the assigned textbooks).  The **second part** should introduce the reader to Campus Lagoon. The purpose here is to provide necessary context for a reader unfamiliar with the site. (Is it tidal? Where does the water come from? What are the physical dimensions? What's the local climate? Does wind matter?) "
